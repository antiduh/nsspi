This projects provides a C# / .Net interface to the Windows Integrated Authentication API, 
better known as SSPI (Security Service Provider Interface).

The project is provided as a .Net 4.0 assembly, but can just as easily be upgraded to .Net 4.5 
or later. The solution file can be opened by Visual Studio 2010 SP1, Visual Studio 2012, or 
later Visual Studio editions.

The SSPI API provides an interface for real authentication protocols, such as Kerberos or 
NTLM, to be invoked transparently by client and server code in order to perform authentication
and message manipulation. These authentication protocols are better known as 'security packages'.

The SSPI API exposes these packages using a common API, and so a program may invoke one or the 
other with only minor changes in implementation. SSPI also supports the 'negotiate' 'meta' 
package, that allows a client and server to decide dynamically which real security provider to 
use, and then itself provides a passthrough interface to the real package.

==== Usage ====

Typically, a client acquires some form of a credential, either from the currently logged on
user's security context, by acquiring a username and password from the user, or by some other
means. The server acquires a credential in a similar manner. Each uses their credentials to 
identify themselves to each other.

A client and a server each start with uninitialized security contexts. They exchange negotiation
and authentication tokens to perform authentication, and if all succeeds, they create a shared 
security context in the form of a client's context and a server's context. The effectively shared
context agrees on the security package to use (kerberos, NTLM), and what parameters to use 
for message passing. Every new client that authenticates with a server creates a new security 
context specific to that client-server pairing.

From the software perspective, a client security context initializes itself by exchanging 
authentication tokens with a server; the server initializes itself by exchanging authentication
tokens with the client.

This API provides raw access to the authentication tokens created during the negotiation and 
authentication process. In this manner, any application can integrate SSPI-based authentication
by deciding for themselves how to integrate the tokens into their application protocol.

The project is broken up into 3 chunks:

 * The NSspi library, which provides safe, managed access to the SSPI API.
 * NsspiDemo, a quick demo program to show how to exercise the features of NSspi locally.
 * UI demo programs TestClient and TestServer (that have a common dependency on TestProtocol) that
   may be run on separate machines, that show how one might integrate SSPI into a custom 
   application.
